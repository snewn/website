          <h3>Programming and Web Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code in 2020, before the 3-month lockdown was implemented in Melbourne,
            because I wanted to make my own video games and learn about databases. Since then,
            I have gained a wealth of experience creating a range of different projects and from web developing. 
            I will be posting my personal projects on this page in the near future, so stay tuned!</p>

          <h3>Research and Scientific Communication</h3>
          <p>My background is in psychology and physiology, but I have always found neuroscience to be incredibly fascinating.
            <br><br>
            While in university, I gained some insightful experience as a sleep research assistant on a project which investigated how accurate
            pupillographic sleepiness tests are at predicting on-road adverse driving outcomes during impairment-related fatigue.
            <br><br>
            For my Honours year, my research was in the field of metabolic neuroscience focussing on obesity. I investigated the role of the
            vagus nerve in mediating the efficacy of vertical sleeve gastrectomy in a rodent model.
