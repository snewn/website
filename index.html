          <h3>Research and Scientific Communication</h3>
          <p>My background is in psychology and physiology, but I have always found neuroscience to be incredibly fascinating.
            <br><br>
            Obesity research:<br>
            My Honours project was in the area of metabolic neuroscience. I studied the complex relationship and communication between our gut and brain,
            specifically via the vagus nerve, after undergoing vertical sleeve gastrectomy.
            <br><br>
            Sleep research:<br>
            During my second year of undergraduate, I was trained as a research assistant for a sleep laboratory. My role ranged from participant recruitment,
            setting up equipments and environment (e.g. EEG, light measurement), to conducting qualitative (e.g. sleepiness questionnaires) and quantitative cognitive (e.g. eye-movement tracking,
            pupil size tracking, driving simulation) and biological (e.g. collecting saliva sample and running subsequent PCR) tests. But the most challenging part was keeping the
            participants awake during their 40-hour sleep deprivation period!
