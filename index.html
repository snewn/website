          <h3>Programming and Web Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code in 2019, before the 3-month lockdown was implemented in Melbourne,
            because I wanted to make my own video games and learn about databases. Since then,
            I have gained a wealth of experience creating a range of different projects and from web developing.

          <h3>Research and Scientific Communication</h3>
          <p>My background is in psychology and physiology, but I have always found neuroscience to be incredibly fascinating.
            <br><br>
            My Honours project focussed specifically on metabolic neuroscience. I studied the change in neural mechanism in a diet-induced obese rat model after they have undergone a bariatric surgery called vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).
            <br><br>
            While looking through the literature for my thesis, one of the most interesting studies I came across was from the Ballsmider (2015) paper which invesigated the integrity of the vagus nerve connection between the gastrointestinal tract and several brain regions after bariatric surgery.
            <br><br>
            In rats, why do you reckon bariatric surgeries result in reduced food intake and reduced body weight? One would assume that it is due to the reduced stomach capacity, but that's not the complete story!
            <br><br>
            VSG procedure was found to trigger the increase in the density of vagal afferents in the nucleus tractus solitarius - the area responsible for relaying information about satiety (among many other functions!). In other words, one would feel much fuller after eating the same amounf of food, not solely because of a smaller stomach, but also because of a relatively stronger signal to the brain!
            <br><br>
            After the roux-en-y gastric bypass, the resident cells of the brain (the microglia) are able to better regulate and maintain the neural networks of the vagus nerve which moderates the communication between the gut and the brain. As they say, communication is key to a healthy relationship...
            <br><br>
            With this said, findings from a single animal study cannot be generalised to a whole population - but how cool is neuroscience?
